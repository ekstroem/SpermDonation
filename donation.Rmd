# Background


Let $Y$ be the number of half-sibling matings per year. Then the 

$$E(Y) = S m P
$$


Expected number of matings 
$$m = \frac{k(k-1)}{2 \cdot 2} + \frac{k f}{2}
$$

> Idea 1: Take the distribution of $k$ and $f$ into account


> Idea 2: Take the age difference into account
###  Upper bound (worst case)
